# Portfolio Optimisation

The motivation of this project is to figure out the optimal portfolio weightage, given a list of assets. The project aims to find an optimal portfolio based on monte carlo simulation of random weightage for each asset and then presenting the portfolios with the least volatility and highest sharpe ratio. The experiment also showcase the effect of adding a volatile but high return asset such as Bitcoin (BTC) to a traditional portfolio.
